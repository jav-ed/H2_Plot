Used mdx with astro and tailwind. Sometimes mdx would not work until used the same code and inserted inside a markdown file.
--> It can't be known wheter the code is not working or just the compilation with mdx is not working

For now the safest way is to use regular markdwon.
For later, if any special mdx features are required, one has to think again. In general .astro and md can be combined quite well

--- access lottifiles --
the files can be inserted inside the public folder, the assets folder did not work up to now. Maybe some modifications in a config are required

astro config:
// https://astro.build/config
export default defineConfig({
  site: "https://jav-ed.github.io",
  base: "/H2_Plot",

File: src/pages/0_Own/0_Acknowledge.mdx

export const lot_Path_Bismillah = "/H2_Plot/0_Lotti/bismillah.lottie";
<dotlottie-player
    id="bismillah"
    class="bismillah_Anim"
    autoplay
    loop
    mode="bounce"
    src= {lot_Path_Bismillah}
    style="width: 100%">
</dotlottie-player>
